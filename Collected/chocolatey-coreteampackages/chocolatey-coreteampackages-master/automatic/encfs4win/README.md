EncFS encrypts individual files, by translating all requests for the virtual EncFS filesystem into the equivalent encrypted operations on the raw filesystem.

A GUI for encfs4win is available through encfsw, providing a tray icon that makes mounting and unmounting encrypted partitions even easier!

EncFS provides an encrypted filesystem in user-space, using the Dokan library for the filesystem interface. EncFS is open source software, licensed under the LGPL.

## Notes
