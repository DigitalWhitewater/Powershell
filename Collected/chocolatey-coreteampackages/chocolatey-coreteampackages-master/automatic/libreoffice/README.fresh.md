LibreOffice is the free power-packed Open Source personal productivity suite for Windows, Macintosh and Linux, that gives you six feature-rich applications for all your document production and data processing needs.

## Notes

- This package installs the latest stable version of LibreOffice (Fresh) with the most recent features. For more conservative users it is recommended to install [libreoffice-oldstable](/packages/libreoffice-oldstable) instead.
- Older versions of this package are likely broken because the LibreOffice team removes the download links for older versions after each update.
