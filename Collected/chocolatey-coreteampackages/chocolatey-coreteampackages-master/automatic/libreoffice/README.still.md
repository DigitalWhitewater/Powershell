LibreOffice is the free power-packed Open Source personal productivity suite for Windows, Macintosh and Linux, that gives you six feature-rich applications for all your document production and data processing needs.

## Notes

- LibreOffice Still is the stable version that has undergone more testing (over a longer time). This version is recommended for more conservative users. If you want the latest version, install the [libreoffice](/packages/libreoffice) package instead.
- Older versions of this package are likely broken because the LibreOffice team removes the download links for older versions after each update.
