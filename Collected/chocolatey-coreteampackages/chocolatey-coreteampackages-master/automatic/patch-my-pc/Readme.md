A key component of staying safe online is keeping your computer up-to-date. Hackers and virus writers love outdated software. It might contain a security vulnerability or "hole" that can provide them with access to your computer. Outdated software can also be buggy, or have performance issues, which is usually fixed with a newer version of the software. These are two of the main reasons why it is important to keep the software on your computer updated (or "patched").
