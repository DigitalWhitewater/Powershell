The Adobe Flash Player is freeware software for viewing multimedia, executing Rich Internet Applications, and streaming video and audio, content created on the Adobe Flash platform.

## Notes

- This package is only for Windows XP to Windows 7, because Windows 8 already contains an integrated Flash Player for Internet Explorer.
- **Warning**: The installation of Flash Player ActiveX fails with a 1603 error when Internet Explorer is open.
