Secret Maryo Chronicles is an Open Source two-dimensional platform game with a design similar to classic computer games. SMC has computer support to a great degree by using an accelerated Open Graphics Library for the best possible graphic design and stock performance.

### Note

- This package installs the game and the music addon. The uninstaller doesn’t work silently. If Secret Maryo Chronicles is already installed, the installer script doesn’t work silently.
- Development have ceased on this game, so do not expect any bugfixes for it.
