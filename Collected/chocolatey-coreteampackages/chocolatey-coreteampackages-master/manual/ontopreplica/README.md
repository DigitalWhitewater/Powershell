A real-time, always on top, "replica" of a window of your choice, based on DWM Thumbnails. Completely written in C# for .NET 4.0/4.5, makes use of the Windows Forms Aero library.

## Features

- Clone any of your windows and keep it always on top while working with other windows,
- Select a subregion of the cloned window:
- Store the selected subregions for future use,
- Now with relative subregions from the window's borders.
- Auto-resizing (fit the original window, half, quarter and fullscreen mode),
- Position lock on the screen's corners,
- Adjustable opacity,
- Click forwarding allows to interact with the cloned window,
- Click-through allows to click through the cloned thumbnail (especially useful with partial opacity),
- Group switch mode automatically switches through a group of windows while you use them,
- Non invasive installation: doesn't require administrator elevation.

## Notes

- CodePlex is planning to shut down in December 2017, after that it is unlikely that this package will ever be updated again.
