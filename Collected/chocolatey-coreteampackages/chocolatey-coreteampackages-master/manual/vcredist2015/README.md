Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 installs run-time components of Visual C++ libraries. These components are required to run C++ applications that are developed using Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 and link dynamically to Visual C++ libraries. The packages can be used to run such applications on a computer even if it does not have Visual Studio 2015 installed. These packages also install run-time components of C Runtime (CRT), Standard C++, MFC, C++ AMP, and OpenMP libraries.
