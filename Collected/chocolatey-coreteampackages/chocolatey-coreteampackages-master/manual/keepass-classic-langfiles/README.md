KeePass Classic (1.x) is a free, open source, light-weight and easy-to-use password manager.

This package extracts a ZIP with all language files into the KeePass program folder. The language, however, must then be manually selected in the KeePass settings. Credits of the translation files: http://keepass.info/translations.html
