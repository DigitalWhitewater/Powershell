**NOTE:** This package has been deprecated in favour of the jre8 package

Java allows you to play online games, chat with people around the world, calculate your mortgage interest, and view images in 3D, just to name a few. It's also integral to the intranet applications and other e-business solutions that are the foundation of corporate computing.

### Note

This package installs the Java version offered at https://www.java.com (currently Java 7). It also sets `SPONSORS=0` ([see docs](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/windows/jre-installer-options.html#running)).

If you want Java 8, install the [jre8](/packages/jre8) package instead.

This only installs the Java Runtime with the bitness specific to your OS (either 32- or 64-bit). If you want both 32-bit and 64-bit JREs on your 64-bit OS, install [javaruntime](/packages/javaruntime) instead.
