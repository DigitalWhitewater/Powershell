### How to use

1. Download the entire repository. You can do this using the Github Desktop application, or by browsing to the root and clicking on the green `Download` button.
2. Extract the entire repository to a temporary locaction.
2. Create a new package and point it to the source location for the files in the `Configuration` folder.
3. Import the desired task sequence.  Note that you will need to point to a UNC path, and to ignore dependencies.
4. Edit the task sequence, and fix all missing packages (and paths, if you changed the source file paths).
5. Distribute and deploy.
